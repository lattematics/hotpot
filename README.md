# HealthUs Web Portal of Mental Health Resources 

## About 
This is a capstone project for the Informatics degree at the UW iSchool, during 2025. 

HealthUs is a web portal that compiles a variety of mental health resources that is accessible, low-cost, and personalized for each user's unique needs. Our aim is to allow our users to improve their well-being by reducing barriers such as cost, time, place, and any stigma that may be stopping them from finding help. 
Our current target audiences are young adults around the age of 18 who may have limited financial resources, but we hope to eventually expand further to help all individuals who may benefit from our web portal.
